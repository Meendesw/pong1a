<H> Best Frank Ocean song</H>

<h2>White ferrari</h2>
<p>I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
  <p>  You say we're small and not worth the mention 
  <p>  You're tired of movin', your body's achin'
  <p> We could vacay, there's places to go
  <p>Clearly this isn't all that there is
  <p> Can't take what's been given
   <p> But we're so okay here, we're doing fine
   <p> Primal and naked
   <p> You dream of walls that hold us imprisoned
   <p> It's just a skull, least that's what they call it
    <p>And we're free to roam </p>
